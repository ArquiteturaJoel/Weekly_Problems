## Question 1

Print this pyramid for n number of lines:

```bash
        1
      2 3 2
    3 4 5 4 3
  4 5 6 7 6 5 4
5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5
```

here n is 5.


## Question 2

Given an array of integers, find a combination of four elements in the array whose sum is equal to a given value X.

Input:
First line consists of an integer N, denoting the number of elements in an array. Second line consists of N spaced array elements. Third line of input will have X.

Output:
Single line output, print 1 if combination is found else 0.

For example,

```bash
Input:
6
1 5 1 0 6 0
7

## Question 3

Vitya has just started learning Berlanese language. It is known that Berlanese uses the Latin alphabet. Vowel letters are "a", "o", "u", "i", and "e". Other letters are consonant.

In Berlanese, there has to be a vowel after every consonant, but there can be any letter after any vowel. The only exception is a consonant "n"; after this letter, there can be any letter (not only a vowel) or there can be no letter at all. For example, the words "harakiri", "yupie", "man", and "nbo" are Berlanese while the words "horse", "king", "my", and "nz" are not.

Input
The first line of the input contains the string s,(1≤|s|≤100), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

Output
Print "YES" if there is a vowel after every consonant except "n", otherwise print "NO".
For example,

```bash
input:
sumimasen

output:
YES
```

## Question 4

Given an integer n, find the nth Fortunate Number.
A Fortunate number is the smallest integer m > 1 such that, for a given positive integer n, pn + m is a prime number. Here pn is the product of the first n prime numbers, i.e prime factorials (or primorials) of order n.

```bash
Example:
Input
3
Output:
7
Explanation:
 ​7 must be added to the product of first 3 prime numbers to make the product prime. 2 x 3 x 5 = 30, need to add 7 to make it 37, which is a prime.
